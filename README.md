Assignment 3

The purpose of this assignment is to approximate the values of differentials using the Euler and Runge-Kutta. We will also characterize matrices.

To compile you will need to have python installed as well as numpy. You can do this by opening your command prompt and typing in:

pip install numpy

After that, to run the code you will need to change the directory to the folder where the file was downloaded. Ex: If the file was dowloaded to the "Downloads" folder you'd type:

cd Downloads

Lastly to run the code, type:

python3 assignment_3.py
